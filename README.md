Task 1
Lena took a checkered sheet, drew a rectangle of size n Ã— 3t on it and begins to fill it with positive numbers: the first line from left to right, the second from right to left, the third from left to right, and so on. At the same time, to make everything look beautiful, she assigns 3 cells to each number and, within the framework of these cells, writes the number to the right. For example 3: 3 or 27: _ 27 (instead of _ it leaves an empty cell, or in your case a space). Write a program that will output what Lena will do.
Input data
The first and only line contains two positive integers n, m <30
Work result
Print what Lena will get (but instead of the character "_" your program should output '').
